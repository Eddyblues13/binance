The fees below could be applied to your account, depending on your trading activity:
</p>
<h5>
Overnight Funding
</h5>
<p>
An overnight funding amount is either added to or subtracted from your account when holding a position after a certain time (referred to as the “Overnight Funding Time”). You can read more about this <a href="../tradingacademy/faq/feescharges/doyouchargeovernightfee.html">here</a>.
</p>
<h5>
Currency Conversion Fee
</h5>
<p>
Plus500 will charge a Currency Conversion Fee for all trades on instruments denominated in a currency different to the currency of your account.
The Currency Conversion Fee will be reflected in real time into the unrealised profit and loss of an open position. You can read more about this <a href="../tradingacademy/faq/feescharges/doyouchargecurrencyconversionfee.html">here</a>.
</p>
<h5>
Guaranteed Stop Order
</h5>
<p>
A unique order type used to help you manage risks by guaranteeing the stop loss level. If you choose to use this feature, please note that as it guarantees that your position closes at a specific requested rate, it is therefore subject to a wider spread. You can read more about this <a href="../tradingacademy/faq/trading/whatisguaranteedstoporder.html">here</a>.
</p>
<h5>
Inactivity Fee
</h5>
<p>
A fee of up to USD 10 per month will be levied, should you not log in to your trading account for a period of at least three months. This fee will be charged once a month from that moment onwards, as long as no login is made to the account.
